# actions-elixir

GitHub Actions for simplifying Stord Elixir operations.

Currently we have these actions available:

- [`setup`](./setup)

## Documentation

Most documentation is automatically generated from the action file itself and placed in the accompanying `README.md` file. Please look at each individual README for more details and usage examples.

## Releasing

Releases are handled via `release-please`. Once a PR is merged, a new PR will be created that bumps all the versions. When that PR is merged the new release will be created and published for consumption.
